# SignedIn
This is a project started at HackingEdu 2015 that utilizes Leap Motion hardware and SDK to build a program that recognizes gestures of the American Sign Language and converts them to their text equivalents.

To test this program, you will need the Leap Motion device, and its driver installed on your computer.
